Thought to classify: "{{node_to_classify_content}}"

Evaluation criteria for thoughts: {{x_eva}}

Based on the context and evaluation criteria, classify this thought. Choose one of the following categories:

- CONTINUE: Further reasoning should proceed from this thought. Use this when:
  * The thought identifies a step in the reasoning process but doesn't provide a complete solution
  * The thought asks a question that needs to be answered
  * The thought sets up analysis that needs to be completed
  * The thought is incomplete or requires elaboration

- TERMINATE_BRANCH: This line of reasoning should not be pursued further. Use this when:
  * The thought leads to a dead end or contradiction
  * The thought is irrelevant to solving the problem
  * The thought repeats previous reasoning without adding value
  * The thought is clearly incorrect or misleading

- FINAL_ANSWER: This thought represents the final solution to the problem. Use this when:
  * The thought provides a complete, definitive answer to the original question
  * The thought concludes the reasoning process with a clear decision or solution
  * The thought directly addresses what was asked in the problem statement
  * The thought contains sufficient justification for the conclusion reached

- BACKTRACK: Reasoning should backtrack and continue from a previous thought. Use this when:
  * The current reasoning path has become unproductive
  * A previous assumption needs to be reconsidered
  * An alternative approach should be explored from an earlier point

IMPORTANT: If the thought directly answers the original problem question or provides a clear final decision/conclusion, classify it as FINAL_ANSWER. Don't continue reasoning indefinitely if a solution has been reached.
